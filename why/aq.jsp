                        </br>
                        StartupMe is a web application that allows to the user to create technological based projects with the propose of finding not only investment but other kind of helps.
                        </br>
                        But...how?
                        </br>
                        Before an user creates the project, it defines a list of achievement considered for the project and fill a points amount for each point. Then other users can contribute with their work and earn points and reputation. This points will be exchangeable for real cash.
                        </br>
                        For example:
                        </br>
                        User A: Wants to create a mobile application, so creates a project and defines some achievements like:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Android UI Interface. Revenue: 100 points. </li>
                            <li>   Mobile app backend logistic and android persistence. Revenue: 190 points.</li>
                            <li>  Logo design: Revenue: 50 points.  </li>
                            <li>  400 points for the application development. Revenue: 5% of stocks</li>
                            <li>  300 points for ads. Revenue: 3,5% of stocks</li>
                            <li> 100 points for creating T-Shirts - Revenue: 1 T-Shirt per 20 points.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Now User B that is an android programmer can program this app and ear 100 points or maybe two users can do this and deal the points.
                        Maybe User C doesn't know how to program but has money, so can change real money for points and can invest in this idea and cover this project monetary demand.
